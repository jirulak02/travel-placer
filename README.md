# travel-placer - 2020

Front-end for a map based website, which was supposed to contain interesting places for travelers all around the world.

I later realized that the project is too large for just one person and had to let it go.

Code should work for you without any changes. If not, get a new MapQuest ID for free and switch it at the end of main.js file.
